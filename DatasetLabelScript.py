Mentions Key Terms: Abstract includes specific terms or concepts directly related to the research topic. Weight: 10. Study Type: Prioritize randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, or meta-analyses. Weight: 8. Sample Size and Details: Specifies a well-defined sample size and population. Weight: 7. Outcome Metrics: Includes measurable outcomes. Weight: 9. Study Design: Preference for longitudinal studies or studies with adequate duration for capturing outcomes. Weight: 7. \nPaper Details Title: "
